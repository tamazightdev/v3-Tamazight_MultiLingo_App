Here is a simple, step-by-step guide to find and download your output files from your Kaggle Notebook.

### Finding Your Kaggle Notebook Output Directory

1.  **Open Your Notebook:** Go to the Kaggle notebook that you just finished running. You should be in the editor view where you can see your code cells.

2.  **Look at the Right-Hand Panel:** On the right side of your screen, there is a panel with several tabs. Click on the **"Data"** tab.

3.  **Find the "Output" Section:** The "Data" panel is split into sections. You will see an "Input" section (where you would add datasets) and an **"Output"** section. The "Output" section is your notebook's working directory.

    *   The path for this directory is always `/kaggle/working/`.

4.  **See Your Files:** Inside the "Output" section, you will see the files your script created:
    *   `gemma-3n-4b-tamazight-ft.tflite` (your model file)
    *   A folder named `tokenizer_assets`

Here is a simple text diagram to help you visualize it:

|                                      |   └── 📁 tokenizer_assets/      |  <-- Your folder is here
|                                      |   └── 📄 gemma-3n-4b-tamazight-ft.tflite |  <-- Your model file is here
|                                      |                                 |

### How to Download Your Files

Now that you've found them, here is how to download them to your computer:

1.  **To Download the `.tflite` file:**
    *   Hover your mouse over the `gemma-3n-4b-tamazight-ft.tflite` file name.
    *   A three-dot menu (`...`) will appear to the right.
    *   Click the three dots and select **"Download"**.

2.  **To Download the `tokenizer_assets` folder:**
    *   **Important:** Kaggle does not let you download an entire folder at once. You must download the files inside it individually.
    *   Click on the `tokenizer_assets` folder to expand it.
    *   You will see the files inside (e.g., `tokenizer.json`, `special_tokens_map.json`, etc.).
    *   Hover over each file, click the three-dot menu (`...`) that appears, and select **"Download"** for each one.
    *   On your own computer, create a new folder named `tokenizer_assets` and save all these downloaded files into it to keep them organized.

You've successfully completed the hardest part. Now you just need to grab your files and move on to the next stage of integrating them into your app.
