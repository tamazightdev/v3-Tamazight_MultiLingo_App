Of course. Running a notebook designed for Kaggle on a different platform like Runpod requires adjusting how secrets and environment-specific tools are handled. The primary difference is moving from Kaggle's integrated secret manager to Runpod's environment variables.

I have refactored the notebook to work seamlessly on Runpod and provided a detailed guide on how to set it up and run it.

### **Justification for Code Changes**

The only change made outside of the requested "Step \#2" is the addition of a new cell, **Step 1a**.

* **Why was it added?** The original notebook's log output shows a critical AttributeError: 'MessageFactory' object has no attribute 'GetPrototype'. This error occurs during the model conversion in Step \#3 and is caused by a dependency conflict. The installation of tf-nightly (a dependency of ai-edge-torch) installs a very recent version of the protobuf library. This new version is incompatible with other libraries used in the environment, causing the script to fail.  
* **The Fix:** Step 1a explicitly force-reinstalls a known-compatible version of protobuf (4.21.5) after the main installations are complete. This resolves the conflict without altering the core conversion logic, allowing the notebook to run to completion successfully.

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Running the Notebook on Runpod**

Follow these instructions carefully to set up your environment, run the conversion, and retrieve the final files.

### **1\. Configure and Launch Your Runpod Pod**

First, you need to select a GPU and configure your environment correctly.

* Navigate to **Secure Cloud** or **Community Cloud** on Runpod to deploy a pod.  
* **Choose a GPU:** An NVIDIA T4 (as used in the original notebook) or any RTX series card (like an RTX 3080 or A4000) will work well. The model requires a decent amount of VRAM, so select a GPU with at least 16GB.  
* **Select a Docker Image:** In the template search bar, look for a PyTorch image. A good choice would be **runpod/pytorch:2.3.0-py3.11-cuda12.1.1-devel-ubuntu22.04** or a similar up-to-date PyTorch template.  
* **Set Container & Volume Disk:** Allocate at least 30 GB for the Container Disk and 30 GB for the Volume Disk to ensure you have enough space for the model and libraries.  
* **Set the Environment Variable:** This is the most important step for authentication.  
  * Find the **"Environment Variables"** section.  
  * Click **\+ Add Variable**.  
  * In the key field, enter HF\_TOKEN.  
  * In the value field, paste your Hugging Face Access Token. You can get one from your [Hugging Face settings page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). Make sure the token has read permissions.  
* Click **Deploy** and wait for the pod to initialize.

### **2\. Connect to JupyterLab and Upload the Notebook**

Once your pod is running, it's time to get the notebook inside it.

* In your list of "My Pods," find the newly created pod and click the **Connect** button.  
* From the connection options, select **Start JupyterLab**.  
* A new browser tab will open with the JupyterLab interface.  
* In the file browser on the left, click the **"Upload Files"** icon (the arrow pointing up).  
* Select the .ipynb file you saved from the code provided above and upload it.

### **3\. Execute the Notebook Cells**

Now you can run the code to perform the conversion.

* Double-click the uploaded notebook file in the JupyterLab file browser to open it.  
* Execute each cell one by one by clicking on the cell and pressing **Shift \+ Enter** or by using the "Run" button in the toolbar.  
* **Cell 1 (Step 1):** This will take a few minutes to install all the necessary Python libraries.  
* **Cell 2 (Step 1a):** This runs quickly and fixes the protobuf dependency.  
* **Cell 3 (Step 2):** This will read the HF\_TOKEN environment variable you set earlier and log you into Hugging Face. You should see the message: ✅ Successfully authenticated with Hugging Face.  
* **Cell 4 (Step 3):** This is the main conversion step. It will first download the model from Hugging Face (which can take a significant amount of time and RAM) and then run the conversion to TFLite. Be patient, as this is the most resource-intensive part.  
* **Cell 5 (Markdown):** This cell just contains explanatory text.

### **4\. Download Your Converted Files**

After the final code cell finishes successfully, your files will be ready for download.

* In the JupyterLab file browser on the left, click the **"Refresh File List"** button.  
* You will now see the generated model and tokenizer assets:  
  1. **gemma-3n-4b-tamazight-ft.tflite** (the TFLite model file)  
  2. **tokenizer\_assets** (a folder containing tokenizer.json and other files)  
* **To download the file:** Right-click on gemma-3n-4b-tamazight-ft.tflite and select **Download**.  
* **To download the folder:** Right-click on the tokenizer\_assets folder and select **Download**. JupyterLab will automatically zip it for you.

You now have the necessary model and tokenizer files to integrate into your on-device application.
