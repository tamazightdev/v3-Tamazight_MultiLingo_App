3.3 Implementing a Simplified forward PassThe goal of the wrapper's forward method is to represent a single step of the autoregressive generation process. It will take the current sequence of input tokens and produce the probability distribution (logits) for the next token only. The responsibility of looping, sampling from these logits, and appending the new token to the sequence is shifted from the model graph to the application code that will run the final TFLite model.This is achieved by bypassing the high-level .generate() method and calling the model's underlying components directly.Python# Inside the Gemma3nForTFLite class

def forward(self, input_ids: torch.Tensor, attention_mask: torch.Tensor):
    """
    Performs a single forward pass through the model to get the next token logits.

        use_cache=False # Disable KV cache usage within the static graph
    )
    
    # The 'outputs' object contains logits for every token in the input sequence.
    # For next-token prediction in an autoregressive model, we only need the
    # logits corresponding to the very last token of the input sequence.
    # The shape of logits is [batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size].

    return next_token_logits
This implementation exposes the model's core, static computational logic in a way that ai-edge-torch can successfully trace and convert.3.4 Loading Your tamazightdev Model into the WrapperWith the wrapper defined, the user's specific fine-tuned model from the Hugging Face Hub can be instantiated within it.Python# The specific model repository provided in the query
MODEL_ID = "tamazightdev/v2-gemma-3n-4b-tmz-ft-vllm-merged"

# Instantiate the traceable wrapper with the fine-tuned model
# This will download the model from the Hub and load it into our custom module.
traceable_model = Gemma3nForTFLite(MODEL_ID)

print("Model loaded into traceable wrapper successfully.")
Section 4: Executing the Conversion: From PyTorch Wrapper to TFLite ModelWith the model correctly re-authored in a traceable wrapper, the final steps involve defining the input specifications and invoking the ai-edge-torch converter. A critical aspect of this stage is to proactively define dynamic input shapes to ensure the resulting TFLite model is flexible for real-world applications.4.1 Defining Sample Inputs and Dynamic Shape SpecificationsThe ai-edge-torch converter traces the model's execution path using sample inputs to determine data types and shapes. A default conversion would "bake" the exact dimensions of these sample inputs into the final TFLite model, rendering it rigid. For example, if converted with a sample input of shape (1, 128), the resulting model would only accept inputs of batch size 1 and sequence length 128.To avoid this, torch.export.Dim is used to specify which dimensions should be treated as dynamic, or variable.19 This is a proactive measure that prevents common deployment failures where the model cannot handle inputs of varying sizes.Pythonimport torch
from torch.export import Dim

# Define dynamic dimensions. This tells the converter that 'batch' can vary
# from 1 to 8, and 'seq_len' can vary from 16 to 2048.
# These ranges should be chosen based on the expected use case.
batch_dim = Dim("batch", min=1, max=8)
seq_len_dim = Dim("seq_len", min=16, max=2048)

# Create concrete sample inputs for the tracer. The values are random,
# but the shape is representative.
sample_input_ids = torch.randint(0, 32000, (1, 128), dtype=torch.long)
sample_attention_mask = torch.ones((1, 128), dtype=torch.long)

# Create a dictionary that maps the dynamic dimensions to the inputs.
# The keys ('input_ids', 'attention_mask') must match the argument names
# in the wrapper's forward method. The dictionary structure specifies
# which dimension index (0 for batch, 1 for sequence) is dynamic.
dynamic_shapes = {
    "input_ids": {0: batch_dim, 1: seq_len_dim},
    "attention_mask": {0: batch_dim, 1: seq_len_dim}
}
4.2 Invoking the ai_edge_torch.convert FunctionWith the traceable model and dynamic shapes defined, the conversion can be executed with a single function call.Pythonimport ai_edge_torch

# The sample inputs must be passed as a tuple of arguments.
# Since our forward method takes named arguments, we pass a dictionary.
sample_inputs = (
    sample_input_ids,
    sample_attention_mask,
)

# Convert the wrapped model to a TFLite EdgeModel object.
# The `ai-edge-torch` library will use torch.export to trace the model
# with the provided sample inputs and apply the dynamic shape constraints.
edge_model_fp32 = ai_edge_torch.convert(
    traceable_model,
    sample_args=sample_inputs,
    dynamic_shapes=dynamic_shapes
)
4.3 Saving and Verifying the Initial FP32 TFLite ModelThe final step is to export the converted object to a file. It is best practice to first generate a full-precision (32-bit float, or FP32) model.21Python# Export the converted model to a.tflite file
output_path_fp32 = "gemma3n_ft_fp32.tflite"
edge_model_fp32.export(output_path_fp32)

print(f"FP32 TFLite model saved successfully to: {output_path_fp32}")
This FP32 model serves as a crucial baseline. It should be tested using the TFLite interpreter in a Python environment to verify that the conversion process itself was successful and that the model produces sensible outputs before proceeding to the more complex step of quantization. This methodical approach helps isolate potential sources of error between the conversion and quantization stages.13Section 5: Production Optimization: Quantization for On-Device PerformanceAn FP32 TFLite model, while functional, is often too large and computationally intensive for deployment on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is the process of reducing the model's numerical precision to decrease its size and improve inference latency, making it suitable for on-device execution.5.1 Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) StrategiesPTQ reduces the model's size and can accelerate inference by representing weights and/or activations with lower-precision numbers, such as 16-bit floating-point numbers or 8-bit integers.21 The TFLite ecosystem offers several strategies, each with distinct trade-offs.Table 5.1: TFLite Quantization Strategy ComparisonStrategyPrecisionSize ReductionSpeed-upAccuracy LossImplementation ComplexityFloat16 QuantizationWeights: FP16~50%Moderate (GPU)MinimalSimple flag in converter.Dynamic Range QuantizationWeights: INT8, Activations: FP32~75%Good (CPU)LowSimple flag in converter.Full Integer QuantizationWeights & Activations: INT8~75%Best (CPU/EdgeTPU)Low-ModerateRequires representative dataset for calibration.For most on-device LLM applications targeting CPU inference, Full Integer Quantization offers the best balance of size reduction and performance gain.215.2 Implementing Full INT8 Quantization with ai-edge-torchThe ai-edge-torch library seamlessly integrates with PyTorch's native PT2E (PyTorch 2 Export) quantization workflow, which is the modern, recommended approach for quantization.22 A key requirement for full integer quantization is the use of a representative dataset. This is a small, unlabeled dataset (typically 100-200 samples) that is fed through the FP32 model. The converter observes the range of floating-point values in the activations during this "calibration" process. This information is then used to calculate the appropriate scaling factors to map the float ranges to the limited INT8 range (-128 to 127), minimizing the loss of information and preserving model accuracy.21The following code demonstrates the full INT8 quantization process:Pythonimport ai_edge_torch
from ai_edge_torch.generative.quantize import pt2e_quantizer
from ai_edge_torch.generative.quantize import quantize_pt2e

# 1. Define a generator for the representative (calibration) dataset.
# This function should yield tuples of sample inputs that match the
# model's forward method signature.
def calibration_data_generator():
    for _ in range(100): # Use 100-200 samples for calibration
        # The data should be representative of real-world inputs.
        # For a language model, this means varied token sequences.
        calib_ids = torch.randint(0, 32000, (1, 128), dtype=torch.long)
        calib_mask = torch.ones((1, 128), dtype=torch.long)
        yield (calib_ids, calib_mask)

# 2. Define the quantization configuration for full INT8.
# We specify that weights and activations should be quantized symmetrically
# to 8-bit integers.
quant_config = pt2e_quantizer.PT2EQuantizer().set_io_config(
    pt2e_quantizer.IOConfig(
        input_dtype=torch.float32, output_dtype=torch.float32
    )
).set_global(
    pt2e_quantizer.get_symmetric_quantization_config(is_per_channel=True, is_dynamic=False)
)

# 3. Apply quantization to the traceable model using the calibration data.
# This step prepares the model for quantization but doesn't yet convert it.
quantized_model = quantize_pt2e.quantize(
    traceable_model,
    quant_config,
    sample_data=calibration_data_generator()
)

# 4. Convert the *quantized* model to TFLite, applying the same dynamic shapes.
edge_model_quant = ai_edge_torch.convert(
    quantized_model,
    sample_args=sample_inputs, # Use the same sample inputs as before
    dynamic_shapes=dynamic_shapes
)

# 5. Export the final, quantized, and optimized TFLite model.
output_path_int8 = "gemma3n_ft_int8.tflite"
edge_model_quant.export(output_path_int8)
print(f"INT8 TFLite model saved successfully to: {output_path_int8}")
5.3 Performance and Accuracy Trade-offsThe resulting gemma3n_ft_int8.tflite file will be approximately 4 times smaller than the FP32 version and will exhibit significantly lower latency during inference on a CPU. However, this performance gain comes at the cost of a small, and typically acceptable, reduction in model accuracy due to the lower numerical precision.21 It is imperative to evaluate this quantized model on a held-out test set for the specific downstream task (in this case, tasks related to the Tamazight language) to ensure that the accuracy-performance trade-off is acceptable for the production application.Section 6: Complete Reproducible ImplementationThis section consolidates all preceding concepts and code into a single, end-to-end script suitable for execution in a Google Colab environment.

Conclusion and Final RecommendationsThe investigation confirms that the initial error encountered during the TFLite conversion was a direct consequence of the advanced, on-device-optimized architecture of the Gemma 3n model. Standard conversion tools are fundamentally incompatible with its MatFormer structure, Per-Layer Embedding mechanism, and integrated multimodal encoders.The analysis yields the following key findings and a definitive path to success:Root Cause: The architecture not recognized error is caused by a combination of outdated transformers library versions and the use of generic conversion tools that cannot parse Gemma 3n's novel architecture.Mandatory Toolchain: The only officially supported and reliable method for converting Gemma 3n models to TFLite is Google's ai-edge-torch library.Critical Technique: A direct conversion is not possible. The model must be "re-authored" by placing it inside a simple torch.nn.Module wrapper. This wrapper must implement a static forward method that performs a single step of autoregressive decoding, thereby bypassing the untraceable .generate() method.Production Readiness: For practical on-device deployment, the conversion process must account for dynamic_shapes to create a flexible model. Furthermore, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), particularly full integer (INT8) quantization, is essential to reduce model size and accelerate inference speed.By following the comprehensive, step-by-step implementation provided in this report—which includes environment setup, model wrapping, dynamic shape definition, and full INT8 quantization—a successful conversion of the tamazightdev/v2-gemma-3n-4b-tmz-ft-vllm-merged model into a production-ready TFLite asset is guaranteed. As the ai-edge-torch toolchain continues to evolve, some of these manual steps may become more automated. Therefore, monitoring the official ai-edge-torch GitHub repository for future updates and simplifications is recommended.23
