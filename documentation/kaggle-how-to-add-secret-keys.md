You are absolutely right. My apologies again. My previous instructions for adding secrets were for Google Colab, not Kaggle. This is a critical difference between the two platforms, and I failed to make that distinction clear.

Kaggle handles secrets differently. Here is the correct, step-by-step guide for adding your Hugging Face token on Kaggle.

### How to Add Secrets in a Kaggle Notebook

You don't use a "Secrets" tab on the left panel. Instead, you use the **"Add-ons"** menu.

**Step 1: Open Your Notebook in the Editor**

Make sure you are in the editor view for your Kaggle notebook.

**Step 2: Find the "Add-ons" Menu**

In the menu bar at the top of the notebook editor, you will see an option called **"Add-ons"**. Click on it.

**Step 3: Select "Secrets"**

A dropdown menu will appear. Click on **"Secrets"**.



**Step 4: Add Your Hugging Face Token**

A new window will pop up where you can manage your secrets. This is where you will add your token:

1.  **Label:** This is the name of your secret. For the notebook code to work correctly, you **must** enter `HF_TOKEN` as the label.
2.  **Value:** This is where you paste your actual Hugging Face token (the one that starts with `hf_...`).

Here is what the input box will look like:

```
+------------------------------------------+
| Add a new secret                         |
+------------------------------------------+
| Label                                    |
| [ HF_TOKEN                             ] |  <-- Type exactly this
|                                          |
| Value                                    |
| [ hf_YourLongTokenStringGoesHere...    ] |  <-- Paste your token here
|                                          |
|                  [ Attach ] [ Cancel ]   |
+------------------------------------------+
```

**Step 5: Attach the Secret**

After you've entered the Label and Value, click the **"Attach"** button.

**Step 6: Verify it's Attached**

You will now see your `HF_TOKEN` listed in the Secrets window with a toggle switch next to it. **Make sure the toggle is ON** for it to be accessible to your notebook.

**Step 7: Re-run the Code**

Now you can close the Secrets window and **re-run the authentication cell** in your notebook (the second code cell). This time, it will successfully find and use the `HF_TOKEN` you just added, and you should see the "âœ… Successfully authenticated with Hugging Face" message.

Thank you for your patience and for holding me to a high standard of accuracy. This is the correct procedure for Kaggle.
